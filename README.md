# Workshop: JS Functional Testing at Scale

There are thousands of ways if not more to set up your automated testing environment. When it comes to stability and maintainability it is crucial to choose the right frameworks at the beginning of the journey. The ecosystem provides a variety of different tools that all rely on certain protocols and come with different levels of support for different use cases.

While there are the traditional WebDriver based JavaScript frameworks like Selenium or WebdriverIO, many new projects have popped up in recent years that provide even more capabilities, particularly for front-end developers.

In this workshop we will take a look at the JavaScript framework landscape for automated functional testing, such as Puppeteer, Playright, Cypress, and others. We will explore what their differences are and how to choose the right tool for your project. Then, we will look at various scenarios, from basic functional test concepts to complex visual and frontend performance tests and complete the session with scaling up our solution using a cloud vendor like Sauce Labs.
